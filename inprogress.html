								<p>I'm currently the game designer and programmer for a tower defense game that's inspired by Teamfight Tactics and Lottery Defense! Our goal for this project is to combine the team build/composition aspect of a traditional tower defense with the RNG aspect of modern autobattlers.
                  We want to encourage players to think strategically and build their team around the RNG they've been dealt. Players will have to compromise and pivot depending on their luck and level! We're currently working on the prototype and we have the turret systems working, but there's still
                  a lot we need to work on. Ian Alvarez, my partner, is working on most of the infrastructure while I work on designing our gameplay systems and assist with prototyping. The video is to showcase our current turret prototyping, but feel free to keep scrolling to see our design docs!

										<h2><a>Tower/Card Unit Design Doc<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/TowerUnits.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is our current design for the game's tower units which includes their stats, tiers, and requirements to upgrade! Damage is broken down by projectile/second, and range is from a scale of 1-10 which will be applied in-engine.

										<h2><a>Enemy Unit Design Doc<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/MonsterUnits.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is our current design for the game's enemy units which includes their stats and abilities! Traits are used to describe their job as a mob. We have only the most essential mobs designed, but will add more as we feel more confident about our prototype! We want to create the core gameplay first before expanding our scope. Feel free to check out the spreadsheet for a more in depth look!

										<h2><a>UI Design<br /></a></h2>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/UIDesign.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is our current design for the game's UI. The mock ups were created on Figma, and serves as a placeholder for us to have an idea of where we should place our UI! Everything is subject to change as later on we could focus more on UI. We are mostly focused on gameplay as of right now!

									<p>This design questions doc is more for my own reference, but I thought it'd be a good idea to post it here to show what my design philosophy looks like! Many of these questions pertain to balancing, and how we can make the player experience more enjoyable and fair!
